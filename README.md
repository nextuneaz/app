## 🔒 Closed Source (Important)
This project is **not open-source**. The distributed app is a **single `.exe`** and **requires a valid license key** to unlock features.

- ✅ End-users download from a website
- ✅ App runs as one executable
- ✅ License gate blocks the main UI until validated
- ✅ Per-PC state/history persists between runs

---

## ✨ Highlights
- **Premium dark UI** (desktop app)
- **License-based access** (authentication required)
- **Windows 10 & Windows 11** support
- **Safe / Medium / Ultra** optimization modes
- **Backups & reports** generated in app data
- **Per-machine history** (local database)

---

## 🖥️ What It Does
Typical actions include (depends on mode/profile):
- Performance tuning (power plan, core parking tweaks where applicable)
- Privacy & telemetry reductions (policy/registry-level changes)
- Background apps & bloat reduction (safe limits)
- Cleanup routines (temp/shader cache cleanup)
- Tools hub (PowerShell helpers, WinUtil integration when configured)

> ⚠️ Some actions can affect system behavior. Use responsibly and always keep a backup.

---

## 📦 Download & Install
**No installer.** Download and run the EXE:

1. Go to the official website: `https://YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD`
2. Click **Download**
3. Run `Nextune.exe`
4. Enter your **License Key** to unlock the app

---

## 🔑 License (How it works)
- On launch, the app shows a **license login screen**
- Without a valid license key, **the main UI is not accessible**
- After successful login, the session is stored locally and can revalidate as needed

---

## 🗂️ Data & Storage
The app stores operational data (logs/reports/backups/database) under a local AppData folder (or portable mode if enabled).

- Logs: app runtime logs
- Reports: generated optimization reports
- Backups: snapshots for undo/restore flows
- DB: per-PC history (machines, scans, runs)

---

## 🧰 Portable Mode (Optional)
You can enable portable behavior (data stays next to the EXE) by:
- launching with `--portable`, **or**
- placing a `portable.flag` file next to the EXE
